        <h1>Tirupathi</h1>
        <p>Tirupati is known as the abode of the Hindu god Venkateshvara, Lord of Seven Hills. The sacred hill of Tirumala is situated about 6 miles (10 km) northwest of Tirupati in Sri Venkateshwara Sanctuary and National Park. The hill was considered so holy that before 1870 non-Hindus were not permitted to ascend it. At the hillâ€™s summit, at an elevation of 2,800 feet (850 metres), is a temple of great antiquity. The temple, nestled among sacred waterfalls and tanks (reservoirs) and dedicated to Venkateshvara, is a fine example of Dravidian art and is one of the most important pilgrimage centres in India. The temple is now the centre of Sri Venkateswara University </p>

        <h1>Tiruvannamalai</h1>
        <p>In Hinduism, Parvati, wife of Shiva, once closed the eyes of her husband playfully in a flower garden at their abode atop Mount Kailash. Although only a moment for the gods, all light was taken from the universe, and the earth, in turn, was submerged in darkness for years. Parvati performed penance with other devotees of Shiva, and her husband appeared as a big column of fire at the top of Annamalai hills, returning light to the world.[11] He then merged with Parvati to form Ardhanarishvara, the half-female, half-male form of Shiva.[12] The Annamalai, or red mountain, lies behind the Annamalaiyar temple, and is associated with the temple of its namesake.[13] The hill is sacred and considered a lingam, or iconic representation of Shiva, in itself.[14] Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva appeared as a flame, and challenged them to find his source.[15][16] Brahma took the form of a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship.[15] In Tamil, the word Arunam means red or fire and Asalam means hill. Since Shiva manifested himself in the form of fire in this place, this name Arunachalam came to be associated with Annamalai hill and the city.[16] The first mention of Annamalai is found in Tevaram, the seventh century Tamil Saiva canonical work by Appar and Tirugnanasambandar

        <h1>Foxsagar Lake</h1>
        <p>Recently I have visited fox sagar lake with my friends.It was a peaceful area and has good scenery.Speaking of its history,The lake was built in 1897 and was a major source of drinking water to residents of Secunderabad. The lake was built before the construction of Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar, were built in the Musi river. This lake was once linked to Hussain Sagar by a tributary of Musi river.[3]</p>
